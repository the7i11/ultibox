# Ultibox

Files for the Ultibox 3D-Printer. Please keep in mind that this project is in an early state. 
Several Ultibox 3D printers are ready-to-print at this moment, yet the project needs much work to be done.

The CAD files are created using Autodesk Inventor, but you can also use Autodesk Fusion360 to open them.
